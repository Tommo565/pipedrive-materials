A list of resources for my friends at Pipedrive =)

## Good Collections of Resources

* [Awesome Machine Learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning) A curated and updated list of ML libraries, frameworks etc.
* [Awesome Production Machine Learning](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning) A curated and updated list of Production ML resources.
* [Awesome Data Engineering](https://github.com/igorbarinov/awesome-data-engineering) A curated and updated list of Data Engineering resources.
* [Machine Learning Examples](https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples) A list of various ML code examples, with some relevent to reccomender systems. Linked to the Lazy Programmer courses on Udemy.
* [Data Science Notebooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks) Huge list of Data Science notebooks.

## General Resources

* [Google Rules of ML](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml) Google's rules of ML. More developer / production focused, but rules 1-7 are very important at the outset of an ML project.
* [Google Good Data Analysis](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/good-data-analysis) Excellent guide on how to approach data analysis.
* [Google AI Software Engineering Research Publications](https://ai.google/research/pubs/?area=SoftwareEngineering) List of Google produced papers relevent to AI & Software development. Very specific topics but lots of them.
* [Machine Learning Yearning](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/90cb81_986a76c2e182457c951d1f649bbe05f3.pdf) Book by Andrew Ng on technical strategy for ML + AI.
* [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/about/) Excellent resource site for ML, Statistics & Analysis. I try not to use too many random tutorials since they can be written by idiots, however this site is excellent!
* [Chris Albon's site](https://chrisalbon.com/) Another great non-idiot site focused more on Pandas and SKL.

## Things to Give to Customers

* [Google ML Glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary) Gloassary of Machine Learning terms.
* [R2D3](http://www.r2d3.us/) A visual introduction to Machine Learning. Very pretty!

## HPC Resources

* [Dask](https://dask.org/) Parallel processing for Python Analytics encompassing Numpy, Pandas and SKL.
* [Modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin) Speed up Pandas with one line of code. Limited but easy.
* [Dask on AWS with Fargate](https://gist.github.com/jacobtomlinson/ee5ba79228e42bcc9975faf0179c3d1a) Setting up a Dask cluster on AWS using Fargate (Amazon's version of Kubernetes). Not tried this so may not work!!

## Specific things I've mentioned

* [ScatterText](https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext) Interactive sentiment visualisation.
* [YellowBrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/) Machine Learning visualisation. Being developed quite quickly - everytime I check back there seems to be new things!
* [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/) Facebook developed library for text classification. Very easy to use.
* [Textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract) Python library that's brilliant for extract text from various documents (pdf, word, pictures etc.)
* [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) Lexicon based sentiment analysis library. Very quick and easy to use. May have been incorporated into NLTK.
* [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) Not had a chance to check this out properly yet, but I've heard very good things about it. Helps manage the Machine Learning lifecycle.
* [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) Again, not had a chance to check this out properly yet, but friends say it's good! Explainability framework for Python / R and can be used with SKL / Keras etc.

## Recommender System Resources

* [Netflix ML Research](https://research.netflix.com/research-area/machine-learning) A lot of resources related to recommender systems, particularly the business side rather than the technical side.
